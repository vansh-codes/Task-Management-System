## Basic Task Management System

This repository houses a basic task management system implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to input tasks along with their priorities and track their completion status. 

### Features:
- **Task Input:** Users can enter tasks along with their priority levels using a user-friendly interface.
- **Task Display:** Tasks are displayed in a tabular format, showing the task name, priority, and status.
- **Task Actions:** Users can mark tasks as completed or delete them as needed.

### Future Enhancements:
While the current version of the system focuses on the frontend implementation, future updates may include:
- **Backend Integration:** Addition of backend functionality to enable data storage, user authentication, and more robust task management features.
- **User Accounts:** Implementing user authentication and account management to allow multiple users to manage their tasks securely.
- **Advanced Task Management:** Adding features such as task categorization, due dates, reminders, and task prioritization algorithms.
- **Collaboration:** Enabling collaboration features such as task sharing, commenting, and real-time updates for teams or groups.

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to collaborate on this project to enhance its functionality and usability.
